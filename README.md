# Hi there, I'm Paul KÓ§ttering! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer who enjoys turning complex problems into actionable solutions using data-driven approaches. I've recently completed my Master of Science in Scientific Computing at New York University, preceded by an Applied Mathematics major (with a Physics minor) at UC Berkeley.

Throughout my academic journey and work experiences, I've had the privilege of working in a variety of fascinating domains. These include Quantum Reinforcement Learning at UC Berkeley, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning at ETH Zurich, and Anomaly Detection in satellite telemetry data at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).

Additionally, I have had the chance to mentor students in mathematical concepts at NYU, guiding them through areas such as multivariable calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra.

I am currently seeking new opportunities in the ML/Data Science field to apply my skills and contribute to innovative solutions. If you are in need of a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer science, let's connect!
