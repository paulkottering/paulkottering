# Hi there, I'm Paul KÓ§ttering! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer who enjoys turning complex problems into actionable solutions using data-driven approaches. I've recently completed my Master of Science in Scientific Computing at New York University, preceded by an Applied Mathematics major (with a Physics minor) at UC Berkeley.

Here are some of the exciting domains I've dabbled in:

- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning at ETH Zurich/NYU 
- Quantum Reinforcement Learning at UC Berkeley 
- Anomaly Detection in satellite telemetry data at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR)

In a world that speaks in data, I am always looking to learn new dialects. I'm currently seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to innovative solutions in the ML/Data Science field. If you are in need of a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer science, let's connect!
